3. Create a virtual environment (replace 'myenv' with your preferred name)
    python -m venv myenv
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    
    - For Unix/Linux:<br>
        ```source myenv/bin/activate```

    - For Windows:<br>
        ```myenv\Scripts\activate```

5. Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:<br>
        ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    
### Run Project
